# AKSNodesusage
There are times when we need to find out the node usage of CPU and memory. Often customer comes up and ask why the pods are not getting scheduled ? 

This basic shell script helps to find out the data in real time to answer queries of the customers.

Feel free to add your input to improve it.

This script is prepared referring to  kubernetes.io and https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17512
